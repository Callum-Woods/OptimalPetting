        https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2002312117

    - The threshold of the final item is âˆž, because the
      rules of the task stipulate that the final item must be
      accepted if no earlier item has been chosen.
       
    - The thresholds for the previous items are determined by
      working backward from the final item, using conditional
      expectations.

    - Lower values are better/more rewarding (e.g., Price)
